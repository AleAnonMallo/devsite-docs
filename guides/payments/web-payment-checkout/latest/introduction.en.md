## Smart Checkout offers:

* A **shopping experience that is adapted** and accessible from any cell phone or computer device on your site.  
* **One click purchases.** When paying with a Mercado Pago account, the details and cards of the buyers are saved, so it allows payments by entering only the security code or money in account.
* **Guest purchases.** It is not necessary to create a Mercado Pago account in order to make the payment.
* **Payment with two different cards.** For example, i cases of high amounts.
